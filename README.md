# GabrielsMind Report Templates

This repository contains **raw Markdown templates** for cybersecurity reporting.  
The goal is to keep reports **consistent, professional, and easy to reuse** across different domains: Red Team, Blue Team, and Exam reports.  

No design, no heavy formatting — just the **raw content structure** inspired by professional pentest reports (e.g., iteratec style).

## Repository Structure
- **[REDTEAM/](REDTEAM/)** → Offensive security reports  
  - **PENTESTER/** → Penetration testing report templates (iteratec-style raw Markdown).  

- **[BLUETEAM/](BLUETEAM/)** → Defensive security reports  
  - Planned templates for SOC daily logs, Incident Response, and Detection Engineering.  

- **[EXAMS/](EXAMS/)** → Exam-related reports and templates  
  - **OSCP/** → Official-style OSCP exam report(s).  
  - **HTB-CPTS/** → HTB CPTS exam report(s).

## Usage
1. Navigate to the appropriate folder (`REDTEAM`, `BLUETEAM`, or `EXAMS`).  
2. Copy the template you need (e.g., `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`) into your engagement/study repo.  
3. Fill in the placeholders `<...>` with your details.  
4. Add supporting files (screenshots, logs, evidence) in subfolders as needed.  
5. Optional: Convert the Markdown report to **PDF/DOCX** for delivery.

- Add **Incident Response & SOC Report** templates (Blue Team).  
- Add **Study/Exam trackers** (Exams).
