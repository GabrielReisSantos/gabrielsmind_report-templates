# Blue Team Report Templates

This section contains report templates and structures related to **Blue Team operations** (defensive security).  

## Structure
- **Incident Response** (planned) → Templates for IR reports, SOC workflows, and daily logs.  
- **Detection Engineering** (planned) → Templates for detection rules and monitoring documentation.  

## Usage
1. Use these templates to document **defensive activities** such as log analysis, incident response, and detection engineering.  
2. Each template is written in Markdown and can be adapted for SOC, IR, or monitoring purposes.  
3. Place related evidence (alerts, logs, dashboards) in a subfolder like `/evidence`.  

## Roadmap
- Add **Incident Report Template** (IR, SOC).  
- Add **Playbooks** for recurring security events.  
- Add **Daily/Weekly SOC Summary Template**.
